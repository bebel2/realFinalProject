Using this interface is actually very simple. The first thing that you have to do is input the variables
of temperature, critical temperature,critical pressure, and specific volume given in the problem. Once these numbers are entered
into their respective edit boxes,then you can calculate the pressure, a, or b variables. You calulate these
by clicking on the button of the respective variable that you want to know. After clicking on the button, a 
message box will appear with the value of the variable that you chose. Then, you can write in the answer for 
the Van der Waals problem that was asked of you and it takes much less time than doing it by hand.
