The author of this assignment swears she has never seen the movie Finding Nemo.
No, for real, this is totally a joke about Captain Nemo from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
Okay, fine, I've never read 20,000 Leagues. But I did see Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water, which has a character named Captain Nemo.

Let's just go watch Finding Nemo.
